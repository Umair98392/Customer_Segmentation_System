# Customer Segmentation System

In this project, we explore a transnational dataset from an online retail company based in the UK. The dataset includes all transactions that occurred between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011. The company specializes in selling unique all-occasion gifts, and it has many customers who are wholesalers.

The primary objective of this project is to perform customer segmentation using RFM analysis. We calculate the RFM metrics for each customer, i.e., Recency (time since last purchase), Frequency (number of transactions), and Monetary Value (total spending). By segmenting customers based on these metrics, the company can tailor its marketing efforts to cater to the unique needs and preferences of different customer segments.
